Then 2 things can happen, they fall in love with your product and become early adopters, or you'll receive back a bunch of constructive criticism that will help you refine your idea.

                <p>The initials T.C.B. stand for Taking Care of Business, 
                which is what Elvis Presley called his group of friends. 
                He incorporated these letters into an emblem flanked by lightning bolts. 
                This emblem was used in several pieces of Elvis' custom jewelry, 
                including his famous T.C.B. ring, necklace, and his private aircraft. 
                This was a group of friends, associates and employees whose main function 
                was to just be around Elvis Presley from 1954 until he died.
